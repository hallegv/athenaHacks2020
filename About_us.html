                      <p>With a new global health concern everyear, everyone is almost always misinformed about what's out there or what is to come. This year with the sudden news of the 
                         Coronavirus, our goal is to provide true and honest information that anyone can access without the bias of over saturated crazy stories people 
                         hear over the internet or from others. With our diverse college collective composing of so many vast Universities, it's easy to get caught up with the constant
                         rumors of the fast spread of Coronavirus that could even be on campus. 
                      <p>We're here to let you know actually what you need to know, what you should do to prepare, and finally to spread the awareness of the safe practices everyone should 
                          do to prevent themsleves and others of potential infection.
                      </p>
